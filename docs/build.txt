Requirements:
- C++ compiler with c++14 support (g++ is recommended)
- Native support implemented now only for x86_64 system V ABI (any x86_64 *nix)

Building should be as easy, as running cmake, for example you can run following:

mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

This builds
- The library itself (build/libnothread.a)
- All demos (which will be in build/demos)
- Test binary (build/nothread-test)
